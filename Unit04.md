**Unit 4: Ulysses** <span id="4"></span> 
*Chronicling the events of a single day in the lives of two characters,
Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, Joyce’s expansive, densely allusive,
and narratologically-innovative* Ulysses*remains one of the most
important, complex, and challenging works in literary history.  As in
the unit on* A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, we will begin our
study of the masterpiece by moving through the novel from beginning to
end, episode-by-episode, addressing major developments and themes as
they arise in the text.  We will then take a step back, discussing
stylistic and aesthetic decisions, and finally take an in-depth look at
some of its principle themes and concepts.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 36 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 4.1: 18 hours

     Instructions: First read the essay titled “The Linati Schema,”
    which details Joyce’s letter to his friend Carlo Linati.  The schema
    will provide you with a useful lens through which to view individual
    chapters.  From *Cornell*’s James Joyce Collection, please read the
    entirety of both short essays for a discussion of the history of the
    text.  
        
     Note on the text: Ulysses is arranged into 18 different episodes;
    in a 1921 letter to Carlo Linati, Joyce associated each episode with
    an element or figure from Homer’s The Odyssey.  This schema has
    become the standard method for identifying each of the episodes, and
    we will use it here.
