**Unit 2: Short Fiction** <span id="2"></span> 
*James Joyce described Dublin as a city of paralysis, and many of his
short stories in* The Dubliners*deal with this concept, featuring
figures trapped by their decisions or unable to find the resources to
escape.  We will examine these tropes carefully, tying them to what we
know about his life and times while relating them to his stylistic and
structural decisions.*  
  
 *First, however, we will begin with a study of Joyce’s Dublin, which he
once termed “the universal city of my work.”  How does Joyce present the
metropolis, and how does he negotiate the complex relations between
place and identity?  We will then take a look at Joyce’s craft, thinking
critically about his signature techniques and stylistic maneuvers,
before examining Joyce’s presentation of characters and their
relationships.  We will devote the last section to his most celebrated
short story “The Dead,” which proves somewhat atypical of the
collection.*
