Many consider James Joyce the most influential author of the
20<sup>th</sup> century.  His innovations in narrative strategy in
particular continue to shape and inspire literature today.  In this
course, we will examine Joyce’s aesthetic and artistic sensibilities
through close readings of the major works in his oeuvre, placing special
emphasis on *Ulysses*, whose expansive length and nearly infinite depths
has sustained scholarship for decades. Before we embark upon our journey
through Joyce’s canon, we will take a look at the life and times of
James Joyce, situating the literary giant within a number of contexts:
the fight for Irish home rule, Modernism, the World Wars, and the Irish
Literary Revival.  We will then progress through his works
chronologically, by date of publication: from the sober, artful short
fiction of the *Dubliners* to the avant-garde wordplay of *Finnegans
Wake*.  By the end of this course, you will not only have read and
thought critically about a number of the most celebrated works of the
last century, but will have evaluated for yourself the reasons for
Joyce’s commanding and revered position within the English canon.
