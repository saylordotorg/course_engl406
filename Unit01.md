**Unit 1: James Joyce the Man** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will begin this course by introducing ourselves to James Joyce the
man, learning what we can about his life and times, including the
authors he gravitated towards, the volatile political situation he was
born into, and his experience of blindness, among other things.  Because
many of Joyce’s works bear an undeniable autobiographical inflection and
frequently reference political figures and events of his day, you may
find this unit particularly useful in deciphering some of the more
obscure allusions in his later works.*
