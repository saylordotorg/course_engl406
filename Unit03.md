**Unit 3: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will explore Joyce’s first novel,* A Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man*, a künstlerroman (or narrative following the
development of an artist) that remains one of the most widely-acclaimed
works of the 20<sup>th</sup>century.  The introductory section has been
designed to draw us through the entirety of the novel, thinking
critically about its structure as a narrative of Stephen’s development
and the various stages through which he progresses.  We will then turn
to matters of style and form, paying special attention to his innovative
use of stream-of-consciousness narration. We will conclude with an
analytical section devoted to the figure of Stephen Dedalus and the
various roles and conventions he fills.*
