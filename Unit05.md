**Unit 5: Finnegan's Wake** <span id="5"></span> 
If readers find *Ulysses* challenging and at times inscrutable: welcome
to *Finnegan’s Wake*, a bold and chaotic adventure into language.
 Lacking a conventional plot and nearly creating its own language, this
final work by James Joyce has been alternately spurned as gibberish and
revered as genius.  In this unit, we will first read the work in its
lyrical entirety, then address its innovative form and style, and
finally move on to major tropes and themes that emerge in the text.

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 27 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 5.1: 18 hours

☐    Subunit 5.2: 9 hours

**Unit 5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Trace the development of Joyce’s literary style to *Finnegans Wake*,
    in which Joyce experiments with his most unorthodox form.
-   Describe the treatment of “the dreamer” figure in the novel.
-   Explain the significance of the use of multiple languages.
-   Compare the treatment of marriage in *Finnegans Wake *to its
    treatment in *Ulysses*.
-   Identify and explain instances of repetition and circularity
    in *Ulysses*.
-   Identify and explain problems with performing traditional critical
    analyses of *Finnegans Wake*.
